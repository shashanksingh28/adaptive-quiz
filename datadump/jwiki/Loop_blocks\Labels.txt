Loop blocks - Labels
Labels can be used to give a name to a loop. The reason to do this is so we can break out of or continue with upper-level loops from a nested loop.Here is how to label a loop:To break out of or continue with a loop, use the break or continue keyword followed by the name of the loop.For example:You needn't worry if you don't understand all the code, but look at how the label is used to break out of the outer loop from the inner loop. However, as such a code is hard to read and maintain, it is highly recommended not to use labels.
