Also, the four lines that begin with either a date or the word "INFO" are printed to System.err and may be above, or below, or even in between the rest of the output. This is because some operating systems may print to System.out and System.err at different times. Check that your output matches the one shown, disregarding the dates and order of the four lines that Spring prints. Now, you have a fully functioning Spring application, but what next?
