JavaBeans - Events
JavaBeans interact with each other by means of events. Events are notifications, a component can give to other components, that something interesting has happened. An example for an event might be a mouse click on a button or the closing of a window. Beans can be source and target of events. To be informed about an event, a bean has to register at another Bean as a listener.The Java event model realizes the observer design pattern with the effect that the inter-component coupling is reduced. Method calls require tight coupling, as caller and receiver need to know each other at compile time, while with events all communication happens solely via interfaces.A special kind of event are PropertyChangeEvents. They are used to restrict some properties to take only specific values, for example for a month integer values between 1 and 12. Every time, such a bound property is modified, notifications to all registered PropertyChangeListeners will be send.
