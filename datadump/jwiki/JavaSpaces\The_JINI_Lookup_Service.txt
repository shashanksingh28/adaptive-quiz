JavaSpaces - The JINI Lookup Service
The lookup service is described in theÂ : Jini Lookup Service Specification (reggie). This service interface defines all operations that are possible on the lookup service. Clients locate services by requesting with a lookup server that implements a particular interface. Client asks the lookup server for all services that implement the particular service interface. The lookup service returns service objects for all registered services that implement the given interface. The client may invoke methods on that object in order to interact directly with the server.
