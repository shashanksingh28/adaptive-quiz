String - Substrings
It may also be sometimes useful to create substrings, or strings using the order of letters from an existing string. This can be done in two methods.The first method involves creating a substring out of the characters of a string from a given index to the end:The index of the first character in a string is 0.By counting from there, it is apparent that the character in index 3 is the second "f" in "coffee". This is known as the beginIndex. All characters from the beginIndex until the end of the string will be copied into the new substring.The second method involves a user-defined beginIndex and endIndex:The string returned by substring() would be "port".Please note that the endIndex is not inclusive. This means that the last character will be of the index endIndex-1. Therefore, in this example, every character from index 3 to index 6, inclusive, was copied into the substring.
