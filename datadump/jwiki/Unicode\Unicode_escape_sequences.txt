Unicode - Unicode escape sequences
Unicode characters can also be expressed through Unicode Escape Sequences. Unicode escape sequences may appear anywhere in a Java source file (including inside identifiers, comments, and string literals).Unicode escape sequences consist ofSuch sequences represent the UTF-16 encoding of a Unicode character. For example, 'a' is equivalent to '\u0061'. This escape method does not support characters beyond U+FFFF or you have to make use of surrogate pairs.[1]Any and all characters in a program may be expressed in Unicode escape characters, but such programs are not very readable, except by the Java compiler - in addition, they are not very compact.One can find a full list of the characters here.Ï€ may also be represented in Java as the Unicode escape sequence \u03C0. Thus, the following is a valid, but not very readable, declaration and assignment:The following demonstrates the use of Unicode escape sequences in other Java syntax:Note that a Unicode escape sequence functions just like any other character in the source code. E.g., \u0022 (double quote, ") needs to be quoted in a string just like ".
