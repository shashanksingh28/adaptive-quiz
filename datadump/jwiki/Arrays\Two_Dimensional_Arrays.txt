Arrays - Two-Dimensional Arrays
Actually, there are no two-dimensional arrays in Java. However, an array can contain any class of object, including an array:It's not exactly equivalent to two-dimensional arrays because the size of the sub-arrays may vary. The sub-array reference can even be null. Consider:Note that the length of a two-dimensional array is the number of one-dimensional arrays it contains. In the above example, weirdTwoDimArray.length is 3, whereas weirdTwoDimArray[2].length is 5.In the code section 3.58, we defined an array that has three elements, each element contains an array having 5 elements. We could create the array having the 5 elements first and use that one in the initialize block.
