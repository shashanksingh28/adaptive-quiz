Remote Method Invocation
Java's Remote Method Invocation (commonly referred to as RMI) is used for client and server models. RMI is the object oriented equivalent to RPC (Remote procedure call).The Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) system allows an object running in one Java Virtual Machine (VM) to invoke methods on an object running in another Java VM. RMI provides for remote communication between programs written in the Java programming language.RMI is defined to use only with the Java platform. If you need to call methods between different language environments, use CORBA. With CORBA a Java client can call C++ server and/or a C++ client can call a Java server. With RMI that can not be done.
