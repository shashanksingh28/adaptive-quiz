History of the Javaâ„¢ programming language - Earlier programming languages
Before Java emerged as a programming language, C++ was the dominant player in the trade. The primary goal of the creators of Java was to create a language that could tackle most of the things that C++ offered while getting rid of some of the more tedious tasks that came with the earlier languages.Computer hardware went through a performance and price revolution from 1972 to 1991. Better, faster hardware was available at ever lower prices and the demand for big and complex software exponentially increased. To accommodate the demand, new development technologies were invented.The C language developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie had taken a decade to become the most popular language amongst programmers working on PCs and similar platforms (other languages, like COBOL and FORTRAN, dominated the mainframe market). But, with time programmers found that programming in C became tedious with its structural syntax.[3] Although, people attempted to solve this problem, it would be later that a new development philosophy was introduced, one named Object-Oriented Programming. With OOP, you can write code that can be reused later without rewriting the code over and over again. In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup developed C++, an enhancement to the C language with included OOP fundamentals and features. . Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.
