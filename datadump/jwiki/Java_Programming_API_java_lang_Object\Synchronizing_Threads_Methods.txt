Java Programming/API/java.lang.Object - Synchronizing Threads Methods
In a multi-threaded environment, when more than one thread can access and modify a resource, the outcome could be unpredictable. For example, let's have a counter variable that is incremented by more than one thread.Beware! Synchronization is an ambiguous term. It doesn't consist of making all threads executing the same code section at the same time. It is the opposite. It prevents any two threads from executing the same code section at the same time. It synchronizes the end of one processing with the beginning of a second processing.The above code is built up by the following sub-operations:Let's say that two threads need to execute that code, and if the initial value of the counter variable is zero, we expect after the operations the value to be 2.In the above case Thread 1 operation is lost, because Thread 2 overwrites its value. We'd like Thread 2 to wait until Thread 1 finishes the operation. See below:
