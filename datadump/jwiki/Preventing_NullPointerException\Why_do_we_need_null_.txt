Preventing NullPointerException - Why do we need null?
The reason we need it is because many times, we need to create an object reference before the object itself is created. Object references cannot exist without a value, so we assign the null value to it.In the code section 6.14 we want to create the Person inside the if-else, but we also want to return the object reference to the caller, so we need to create the object reference outside of the if-else, because of the scoping rule in Java. Incorrect error-handling and poor contract design can be a pitfall with any programming language. This is also true for Java.Now we will describe how to prevent NullPointerException. It does not describe general techniques for how you should program Java. It is of some use, to make you more aware of null values, and to be more careful about generating them yourself.This list is not complete â€” there are no rules for preventing NullPointerException entirely in Java, because the standard libraries have to be used, and they can cause NullPointerExceptions. Also, it is possible to observe an uninitialized final field in Java, so you can't even treat a final field as being completely trusted during the object's creation.A good approach is to learn how to deal with NullPointerExceptions first, and become competent with that. These suggestions will help you to cause less NullPointerExceptions, but they don't replace the need to know about NullPointerExceptions.
