Java Programming/Spring framework - Step 1: Setting up your environment
Before we can directly make the files, we first need to setup Spring. I'm assuming you already have the latest version of Java installed. If not, you can download Java Development Kit here.Spring recommends to use Maven or Gradle to set up your dependencies.[1] If you don't have them installed or provided by your IDE such as Eclipse, you can find instruction how to use and download them here and here. Maven or Gradle will make sure that your dependencies, and those they depend upon are loaded in your project.See section QuickStart in http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/ on how to add spring dependencies to your project. Using maven you will need to provide a pom.xml file with the following content in the root of your project:If you are using Maven make sure that you provide a pom.xml file which contains the following line.From here on out, you can just copy and paste the text into the files for Steps 2, 3, and 4; skip the explanations; and run the program yourself. The explanations are only there to provide you with a background of the way Spring puts it all together. Ok, now on to the meat and potatoes, story_configuration.xml.
