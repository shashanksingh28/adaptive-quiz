Methods - Return parameter
A method may return a value (which can be a primitive type or an object reference). If the method does not return a value we use the void Java keyword.However, a method can return only one value so what if you want to return more than one value from a method? You can pass in an object reference to the method, and let the method modify the object properties so the modified values can be considered as an output value from the method. You can also create an Object array inside the method, assign the return values and return the array to the caller. However, this gives a problem if you want to mix primitive data types and object references as the output values from the method.There is a better approach, define a special return object with the needed return values. Create that object inside the method, assign the values and return the reference to this object. This special object is "bound" to this method and used only for returning values, so do not use a public class. The best way is to use a nested class, see example below:In the above example the getPersonInfoById method returns an object reference that contains both values of the name and the age. See below how you may use that object:
