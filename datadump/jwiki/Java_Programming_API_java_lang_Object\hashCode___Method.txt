Java Programming/API/java.lang.Object - hashCode() Method
In most cases you should not override this method, since the default implementation of this method returns a unique number for the object. The number is used when the object is put into a collection. Finding an object in a big collection may take a while, if objects are compared one by one sequentially. To speed the search up, objects may be placed in a tree structure, weighted by an integer hash code. Comparing the hash code while navigating through the tree, the number of object comparisons can be reduced.To give you a general idea of how it may work, see the above diagram. Let's say we are searching object G. If at each 'node' of the tree we can decide which way to go, then by 3 steps we reach the object G.By constrast in a linear search:We would need 8 steps to reach the object G.So the search will be faster with the tree structure. Adding a new object however, will be slower because the tree structure needs to be maintained. The place of the new object in the tree has to be found first.
