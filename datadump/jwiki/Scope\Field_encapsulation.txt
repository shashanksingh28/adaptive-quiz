Field encapsulation
Generally, it is best to make data private or protected. Access to the data is controlled by setter and getter methods. This lets the programmer control access to data, allowing him/her to check for and handle invalid data.In the code section 3.51, the setName() method will only change the value of name if the new name is not null. Because setName() is conditionally changing name, it is wise to return a boolean to let the program know if the change was successful.
