Statements - Iteration Statements
Iteration Statements are statements that are used to iterate a block of statements. Such statements are often referred to as loops. Java offers four kinds of iterative statements.The while loop iterates a block of code while the condition it specifies is true.The syntax for the loop is:Here the condition is an expression. An expression as discussed earlier is any statement that returns a value. While condition statements evaluate to a boolean value, that is, either true or false. As long as the condition is true, the loop will iterate the block of code over and over and again. Once the condition evaluates to false, the loop exits to the next statement outside the loop.The do-while loop is functionally similar to the while loop, except the condition is evaluated AFTER the statement executesThe for loop is a specialized while loop whose syntax is designed for easy iteration through a sequence of numbers. Example:The program prints the numbers 0 to 99 and their squares.The same statement in a while loop:The foreach statement allows you to iterate through all the items in a collection, examining each item in turn while still preserving its type. The syntax for the foreach statement is:For an example, we'll take an array of Strings denoting days in a week and traverse through the collection, examining one item at a time.Notice that the loop automatically exits after the last item in the collection has been examined in the statement block.Although the enhanced for loop can make code much clearer, it can't be used in some common situations.
