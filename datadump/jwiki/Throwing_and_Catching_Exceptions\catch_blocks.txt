Throwing and Catching Exceptions - catch blocks
A try/catch statement can contain several catch blocks, to handle different exceptions in different ways. Each catch block must take a parameter of a different throwable class. A thrown object may match several catch block but only the first catch block that matches the object will be executed. A catch-block will catch a thrown exception if and only if:This means that the catch block order is important. As a consequence, you can't put a catch block that catches all the exception (which take a java.lang.Exception as parameter) before a catch block that catches a more specific exception as the second block could never be executed.At line 14, we use a multi-catch clause. It is available since the JDK 7. This is a combination of several catch clauses and let's you handle exceptions in a single handler while also maintaining their types. So, instead of being boxed into a parent Exception super-class, they retain their individual types.You can also use the java.lang.Throwable class here, since Throwable is the parent class for the application-specific Exception classes. However, this is discouraged in Java programming circles. This is because Throwable happens to also be the parent class for the non-application specific Error classes which are not meant to be handled explicitly as they are catered for by the JVM itself.
