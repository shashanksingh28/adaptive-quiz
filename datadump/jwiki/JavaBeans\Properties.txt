JavaBeans - Properties
The properties of a bean are all private fields that are accessible and modifiable by public methods. These getter and setter methods should be marked as such by following a simple naming convention: for some property named, say, xxx there should be a getXxx() which returns the property value and a setXxx() which sets the property.
