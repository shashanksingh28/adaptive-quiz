Java Native Interface - Calling native code from JVM
In the JNI framework, native functions are implemented in separate .c or .cpp files. C++ provides a slightly simpler interface with JNI. When the JVM invokes the function, it passes a JNIEnv pointer, a jobject pointer, and any Java arguments declared by the Java method. A JNI function may look like this:The env pointer is a structure that contains the interface to the JVM. It includes all of the functions necessary to interact with the JVM and to work with Java objects. Example JNI functions are converting native arrays to/from Java arrays, converting native strings to/from Java strings, instantiating objects, throwing exceptions, etc. Basically, anything that Java code can do can be done using JNIEnv, albeit with considerably less ease.On Linux and Solaris platforms, if the native code registers itself as a signal handler, it could intercept signals intended for the JVM. Signal chaining should be used to allow native code to better interoperate with JVM. On Windows platforms, Structured Exception Handling (SEH) may be employed to wrap native code in SEH try/catch blocks so as to capture machine (CPU/FPU) generated software interrupts (such as NULL pointer access violations and divide-by-zero operations), and to handle these situations before the interrupt is propagated back up into the JVM (i.e. Java side code), in all likelihood resulting in an unhandled exception.For example, the following converts a Java string to a native string:The JNI framework does not provide any automatic garbage collection for non-JVM memory resources allocated by code executing on the native side. Consequently, native side code (such as C, C++, or assembly language) must assume the responsibility for explicitly releasing any such memory resources that it itself acquires.Note that C++ JNI code is syntactically slightly cleaner than C JNI code because like Java, C++ uses object method invocation semantics. That means that in C, the env parameter is dereferenced using (*env)-> and env has to be explicitly passed to JNIEnv methods. In C++, the env parameter is dereferenced using env-> and the env parameter is implicitly passed as part of the object method invocation semantics.JNI also allows direct access to assembly code, without even going through a C bridge.Native data types can be mapped to/from Java data types. For compound types such as objects, arrays and strings the native code must explicitly convert the data by calling methods in the JNIEnv. The following table shows the mapping of types between Java (JNI) and native code.In addition, the signature "L fully-qualified-classÂ ;" would mean the class uniquely specified by that name; e.g., the signature "Ljava/lang/String;" refers to the class java.lang.String. Also, prefixing [ to the signature makes the array of that type; for example, [I means the int array type. Finally, a void signature uses the V code. Here, these types are interchangeable. You can use jint where you normally use an int, and vice-versa, without any typecasting required.However, mapping between Java Strings and arrays to native strings and arrays is different. If you use a jstring in where a char * would be, your code could crash the JVM.The encoding used for the NewStringUTF, GetStringUTFLength, GetStringUTFChars, ReleaseStringUTFChars, GetStringUTFRegion functions is not standard UTF-8, but modified UTF-8. The null character (U+0000) and codepoints greater than or equal to U+10000 are encoded differently in modified UTF-8. Many programs actually use these functions incorrectly and treat the UTF-8 strings returned or passed into the functions as standard UTF-8 strings instead of modified UTF-8 strings. Programs should use the NewString, GetStringLength, GetStringChars, ReleaseStringChars, GetStringRegion, GetStringCritical, and ReleaseStringCritical functions, which use UTF-16LE encoding on little-endian architectures and UTF-16BE on big-endian architectures, and then use a UTF-16 to standard UTF-8 conversion routine.The code is similar with Java arrays, as illustrated in the example below that takes the sum of all the elements in an array.Of course, there is much more to it than this.A JNI environment pointer (JNIEnv*) is passed as an argument for each native function mapped to a Java method, allowing for interaction with the JNI environment within the native method. This JNI interface pointer can be stored, but remains valid only in the current thread. Other threads must first call AttachCurrentThread() to attach themselves to the VM and obtain a JNI interface pointer. Once attached, a native thread works like a regular Java thread running within a native method. The native thread remains attached to the VM until it calls DetachCurrentThread() to detach itself.To attach to the current thread and get a JNI interface pointer:To detach from the current thread:
