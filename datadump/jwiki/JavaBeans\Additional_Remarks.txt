JavaBeans - Additional Remarks
A big strength of the JavaBean component model is that it is designed for simplicity. Developing JavaBeans is very simple, because a lot of behavior (like the platform independence or packaging mechanism) is supported in the Java Programming Language by default. However, one can optionally equip beans with additional objects like BeanInfos or custom PropertyEditors to use the component model in a more flexible way. A second facility is that Sun designed the whole Swing GUI library according to the JavaBeans component model. Thereby Swing components can easily be composed in visual builder tools.However, JavaBeans do not realize all features of a component model. A drawback is that JavaBeans are restricted to the Java programming language, while an important goal of components is the independence of an implementation language.
