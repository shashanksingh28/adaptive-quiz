Java Programming/Spring framework - Step 3: Making JavaBean classes
There are two JavaBean classes: Story.java and StoryList.java, both in the package spring. Copy and paste the following text into their respective classes.Not too complicated, right? These are JavaBeans; simple classes with getters and setters for property variables, and a constructor without any parameters. For a more in-depth discussion of JavaBeans visit Wikipedia:JavaBeans. The setters, like setTitle(String title), are what Spring uses to create the beans in the XmlBeanFactory. The setters must follow specific bean naming conventions. For example, settitle(String title) with a lowercase "t" won't work. However, as an example setURL(String url) with property name "URL" will work because the second letter "R" is also capitalized in addition to the first "U". Getters aren't actually used by Spring in this example, however StoryReader needs them as we'll see later on. In addition, we don't actually have to specify a no-argument constructor, we could just leave it out and the Java compiler will automatically put one in the class when it's compiled. However, writing a constructor with one or more arguments without a no-argument constructor would invalidate the class as a bean.
