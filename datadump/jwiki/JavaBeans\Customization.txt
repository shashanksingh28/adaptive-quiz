JavaBeans - Customization
Customization is done via Property Editors. A property editor is a tool for customizing at design time a particular property type. Property editors are activated from so-called property sheets, which display all properties of a bean. If a property is selected for customization, the property sheet finds out the type of the property, displays the appropriate property editor with the property's current value.
