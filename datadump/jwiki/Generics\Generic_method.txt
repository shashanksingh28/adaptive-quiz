Generics - Generic method
A generic type can be defined for just a method:Here a new identifier (D) has been chosen at the beginning of the method declaration. The type is specific to a method call and different types can be used for the same object instance:The actual type will be defined by the type of the method parameter. Hence, the generic type can't be defined only for the return value as it wouldn't be resolved. See the Class<T> section for a solution.
