History of the Javaâ„¢ programming language - Versions
Unlike C and C++, Java's growth is pretty recent. Here, we'd quickly go through the development paths that Java took with age.Introduced in 1996 for the Solaris, Windows, Mac OS Classic and Linux, Java was initially released as the Java Development Kit 1.0 (JDK 1.0). This included the Java runtime (the virtual machine and the class libraries), and the development tools (e.g., the Java compiler). Later, Sun also provided a runtime-only package, called the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The first name stuck, however, so usually people refer to a particular version of Java by its JDK version (e.g., JDK 1.0).Introduced in 1998 as a quick fix to the former versions, version 1.2 was the start of a new beginning for Java. The JDKs of version 1.2 and later versions are often called Java 2 as well. For example, the official name of JDK 1.4 is The Java(TM) 2 Platform, Standard Edition version 1.4.Released in 8 May 2000. The most notable changes were:Released in 6 February 2002, Java 1.4 has improved programmer productivity by expanding language features and available APIs:Released in September 2004Released on 11 December 2006.[4]What's New in Java SE 6:Released on 28 July 2011.Feature additions for Java 7 include:[5]Lambda (Java's implementation of lambda functions), Jigsaw (Java's implementation of modules), and part of Coin were dropped from Java 7. Java 8 will be released with the remaining features in summer 2013.[18]
