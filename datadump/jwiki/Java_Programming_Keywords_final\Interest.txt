Interest
The final keyword is mostly used to guarantee a good usage of the code. For instance (non-static) methods, this allows the compiler to expand the method (similar to an inline function) if the method is small enough. Sometimes it is required to use it. For instance, a nested class can only access the members of the top-level class if they are final.
