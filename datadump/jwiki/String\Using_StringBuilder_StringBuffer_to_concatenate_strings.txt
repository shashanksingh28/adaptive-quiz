String - Using StringBuilder/StringBuffer to concatenate strings
Remember that String objects are immutable objects. Once a String is created, it can not be modified, takes up memory until garbage collected. Be careful of writing a method like this:On the + operation a new String object is created at each iteration. Suppose words contains the elements ["Foo", "Bar", "Bam", "Baz"]. At runtime, the method creates thirteen Strings:Even though only the last one is actually useful.To avoid unnecessary memory use like this, use the StringBuilder class. It provides similar functionality to Strings, but stores its data in a mutable way. Only one StringBuilder object is created. Also because object creation is time consuming, using StringBuilder produces much faster code.As StringBuilder isn't thread safe (see the chapter on Concurrency) you can't use it in more than one thread. For a multi-thread environment, use StringBuffer instead which does the same and is thread safe. However, StringBuffer is slower so only use it when it is required. Moreover, before Java 5 only StringBuffer existed.
