Comments - Syntax
The comments in Java use the same syntax as in C++.An end-of-line comment starts with two slashes and ends with the end of the line. This syntax can be used on a single line too.A comment on several lines is framed with '/' + '*' and '*' + '/'.By convention, subsequent lines of slash-star comments begin with a star aligned under the star in the open comment sequence, but this is not required. Never nest a slash-star comment in another slash-star comment. If you accidentally nest such comments, you will probably get a syntax error from the compiler soon after the first star-slash sequence.If you need to have the sequence */ inside a comment you can use html numeric entities: *&#47;.Slash-star comments may also be placed between any Java tokens, though not recommended:However, comments are not parsed as comments when they occur in string literals.It results in a 33 character string.
