Keywords - finally
finally is a keyword which is an optional part of the try block.The code inside the finally block will always be executed. This is also true for cases when there is an exception or even executed return statement in the try block.Three things can happen in a try block. First, no exception is thrown:You can see that we have passed in the try block, then we have executed the finally block and we have continued the execution. Now, a caught exception is thrown:We have passed in the try block until where the exception occurred, then we have executed the matching catch block, the finally block and we have continued the execution. Now, an uncaught exception is thrown:We have passed in the try block until where the exception occurred and we have executed the finally block. NO CODE after the try-catch block has been executed. If there is an exception that happens before the try-catch block, the finally block is not executed.If return statement is used inside finally, it overrides the return statement in the try-catch block. For instance, the constructwill return 12, not 11. Professional code almost never contains statements that alter execution order (like return, break, continue) inside the finally block, as such code is more difficult to read and maintain.
