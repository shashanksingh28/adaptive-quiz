Remote Method Invocation - STUB and SKELETON
The remote method invocation goes through a STUB on the client side and a so called SKELETON on the server side.Prior to Java 1.2 the skeleton had to be explicitly generated with the rmic tool. Since 1.2 a dynamic skeleton is used, which employs the features of Java Reflection to do its work.
