Boolean operators
The Java boolean operators are based on the operations of the boolean algebra. The boolean operators operate directly on boolean values.Here is a list of four common boolean operators in Java:The boolean NOT operator ("!") inverts the value of a boolean expression. The boolean AND operator ("&&") will result in true if and only if the values on both sides of the operator are true. The boolean inclusive OR operator ("||") will result in true if either or both of the values on the sides of the operator is true. The boolean exclusive XOR operator ("^") will result in true if one and only of the values on the sides of the operator is true.To show how these operators are used, here is an example:Here are the truth tables for the boolean operators:In Java, boolean logic has a useful property called short circuiting. This means that expressions will only be evaluated as far as necessary. In the expression (a && b), if a is false, then b will not be evaluated because the expression will be false no matter what. Here is an example that shows that the second expression is not automatically checked:To disable this property, you can use & instead of && and | instead of || but it's not recommended.
