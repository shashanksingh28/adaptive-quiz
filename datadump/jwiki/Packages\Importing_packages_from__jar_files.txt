Packages - Importing packages from .jar files
If you are importing library packages or classes that reside in a .jar file, you must ensure that the file is in the current classpath (both at compile- and execution-time). Apart from this requirement, importing these packages and classes is the same as if they were in their full, expanded, directory structure.For example, to compile and run a class from a project's top directory (that contains the two directories /source and /libraries) you could use the following command:And then to run it, similarly:The above is simplified, and demands that MainClass be in the default package, or a package called source, which isn't very desirable.With BlueJ just click on Tools, Preferences, Libraries, and add the .jar one by one.
