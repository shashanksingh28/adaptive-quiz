Methods - Parameter passing
We can pass any primitive data types or objects to a method but the two are not processed the same way.The primitive types are passed in by value. It means that as soon as the primitive type is passed in, there is no more link between the value inside the method and the source variable:As you can see in code section 3.70, the modifyValue() method has not modified the value of i.The object references are passed by value. It means that:You must understand the difference between the reference of an object and the object itself. A object reference is the link between a variable name and an instance of object:An object reference is a pointer, an address to the object instance.The object itself is the value of its attributes inside the object instance:Take a look at the example above:The name has changed because the method has changed the object itself and not the reference. Now take a look at the other example:The name has not changed because the method has changed the reference and not the object itself. The behavior is the same as if the method was in-lined and the parameters were assigned to new variable names:
