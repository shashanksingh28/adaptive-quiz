Java Security
Since Java 1.2, the Java platform itself comes with a security model built into applications it runs. It provides an access controller similar to what the Java enabled browser provides for an applet.There are two main ways we can add security to our application. One way is to add a Class loader, or a security manager. The other way is to run your application under an other program, that can be called JavaRunner. JavaRunner can be used to run applications, the same way as appletviewer is used to run applets.
