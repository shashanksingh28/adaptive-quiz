Static methods
A static method is a method that can be called without an object instance. It can be called on the class directly. For example, the valueOf(String) method of the Integer class is a static method:As a consequence, it cannot use the non-static methods of the class but it can use the static ones. The same way, it cannot use the non-static attributes of the class but it can use the static ones:You can notice that when you use System.out.println(), out is a static attribute of the System class. A static attribute is related to a class, not to any object instance, so there is only one value for all the object instances. This attribute is unique in the whole Java Virtual Machine. All the object instances use the same attribute:
