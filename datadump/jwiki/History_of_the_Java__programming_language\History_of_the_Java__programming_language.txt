History of the Javaâ„¢ programming language
On 23 May 1995, John Gage, the director of the Science Office of the Sun Microsystems along with Marc Andreesen, co-founder and executive vice president at Netscape announced to an audience of SunWorldTM that Java technology wasn't a myth and that it was a reality and that it was going to be incorporated into Netscape Navigator.[1]At the time the total number of people working on Java was less than 30.[1] This team would shape the future in the next decade and no one had any idea as to what was in store.
