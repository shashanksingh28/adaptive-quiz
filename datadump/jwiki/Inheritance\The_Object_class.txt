Inheritance - The Object class
At the instantiating, the child class receives the features inherited from its superclass, which also has received the features inherited from its own superclass and so on to the Object class. This mechanism allows to define reusable global classes, whose user details the behavior in the derived more specific classes.In Java, a class can only inherit from one class. Java does not allow you to create a subclass from two classes, as that would require creating complicated rules to disambiguate fields and methods inherited from multiple superclasses. If there is a need for Java to inherit from multiple sources, the best option is through interfaces, described in the next chapter.
