Java Programming/Struts - Struts Config in a Nutshell
A web application uses a deployment descriptor to initialize resources like servlets and taglibs . The deployment descriptor is formatted as a XML document and named "web.xml". Likewise, the framework uses a configuration file to initialize its own resources. These resources include ActionForms to collect input from users, ActionMappings to direct input to server-side Actions , and ActionForwards to select output pages.The initialisation of struts is acheived through the inclusion of the following in the web.xml fileHere's a simple configuration (struts-config.xml) for a login workflow:There are several other resources you can specify in the framework's configuration file. You can specify validations for the ActionForms in an XML descriptor, using the Struts Validator. A standard extension, Tiles , helps you build pages from smaller fragments.Struts Action Framework is extensible. Every class deployed by the framework can be replaced by your own default class. The properties of your default class can be set using the Digester's set-property feature. This is one reason why there are so many contributor extensions.Tiles is a contributor extension.
