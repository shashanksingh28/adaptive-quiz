Overview - First applet
The two things you must at least create is an HTML page and a Java class. It can be done on a local folder, no need to run a server but it will be harder to understand what is local, what is remote. The HTML page has to call the Java class using the <applet/> markup:Save this file on a folder. As the <applet/> markup is calling a Java class called HelloWorld, our class should be called HelloWorld.java:Save this file and compile the class on the same folder. Now let's open the web page on a browser:We clearly see that "Hello, world!" is not rendered the same way as the rest of the page.
