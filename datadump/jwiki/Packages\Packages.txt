Packages
If your application becomes quite big, you may have lots of classes. Although you can browse them in their alphabetic order, it becomes confusing. So your application classes can be sorted into packages.A package is a name space that mainly contains classes and interfaces. For instance, the standard class ArrayList is in the package java.util. For this class, java.util.ArrayList is called its fully qualified name because this syntax has no ambiguity. Classes in different packages can have the same name. For example, you have the two classes java.util.Date and java.sql.Date which are not the same. If no package is declared in a class, its package is the default package.
