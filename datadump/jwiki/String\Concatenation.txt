String - Concatenation
The Java language provides special support for the string concatenation with operator +:The concatenation is not always processed at the same time. Raw string literals concatenation is done at compile time, hence there is a single string literal in the byte code of the class. Concatenation with at least one object is done at runtime.+ operator can concatenate other objects with strings. For instance, integers will be converted to strings before the concatenation:Each Java object has the String toString() inherited from the Object class. This method provides a way to convert objects into Strings. Most classes override the default behavior to provide more specific (and more useful) data in the returned String:
