Classes, Objects and Types
An object is composed of fields and methods. The fields, also called data members, characteristics, attributes, or properties, describe the state of the object. The methods generally describe the actions associated with a particular object. Think of an object as a noun, its fields as adjectives describing that noun, and its methods as the verbs that can be performed by or on that noun.For example, a sports car is an object. Some of its fields might be its height, weight, acceleration, and speed. An object's fields just hold data about that object. Some of the methods of the sports car could be "drive", "park", "race", etc. The methods really don't mean much unless associated with the sports car, and the same goes for the fields.The blueprint that lets us build our sports car object is called a class. A class doesn't tell us how fast our sports car goes, or what color it is, but it does tell us that our sports car will have a field representing speed and color, and that they will be say, a number and a word (or hex color code), respectively. The class also lays out the methods for us, telling the car how to park and drive, but these methods can't take any action with just the blueprint â€” they need an object to have an effect.In Java, a class is located in a file similar to its own name. If you want to have a class called SportsCar, its source file needs to be SportsCar.java. The class is created by placing the following in the source file:The class doesn't do anything yet, as you will need to add methods and field variables first.The objects are different from the primitive types because:
