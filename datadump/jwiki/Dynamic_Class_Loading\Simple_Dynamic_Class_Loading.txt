Simple Dynamic Class Loading
An easy way to dynamically load a Class is via the java.net.URLClassLoader class. This class can be used to load a Class or a collection of classes that are accessible via a URL. This is very similar to the -classpath parameter in the java executable. To create a URLClassLoader, use the factory method (as using the constructor requires a security privilege):Unlike other dynamic class loading techniques, this can be used even without security permission provided the classes come from the same Web domain as the caller. Once a ClassLoader instance is obtained, a class can be loaded via the loadClass method. For example, to load the class com.example.MyClass, one would:Executing code from a Class instance is explained in the Dynamic Invocation chapter.
