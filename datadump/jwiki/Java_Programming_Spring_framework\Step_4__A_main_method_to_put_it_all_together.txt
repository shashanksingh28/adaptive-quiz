Java Programming/Spring framework - Step 4: A main method to put it all together
As we have before, copy and paste the text. And save your class as StoryReader.java.Here is our main class, StoryReader.java in package spring. First we have to import two Spring classes, XmlBeanFactory and ClassPathResource. XmlBeanFactory is essentially a Java class representation of the Spring XML configuation file, story_configuration.xml. However, before we can get the XML file, we have to tell Spring to look in our class path for that file. That's where ClassPathResource comes in. It searchs the class path, which is where our .class files are stored, for the file specified in its constructor, story_configuration.xml. Any other class that implements the Resource interface may be used, such as org.springframework.core.io.FileSystemResource. Therefore, we see XmlBeanFactory beanFactory = new XmlBeanFactory(new ClassPathResource("story_configuration.xml")); creates a new bean factory from story_configuration.xml.The next line, StoryList storyList = (StoryList) beanFactory.getBean("StoryList");, tells us which bean we want to get next. The getBean("StoryList") tells the bean factory to return an object corresponding to the bean with the id "StoryList", since it is the class name. Since it is an Object, we have to cast it into a StoryList class.Next, we get the list of stories from the StoryList class, and loop through them. Since this is a bean, the Stories are already there in the list, within the values already in the stories. All we have to do is print them out; which we do. Note: \" is used to escape quotes within the String.
