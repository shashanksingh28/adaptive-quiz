Threads and Runnables - Where are threads used?
Threads are used intensively in applications that require a considerable amount of CPU usage. For operations that are time-consuming and intensive, it is usually advised to use threads. A example of such an application would be a typical video game. At any given time, a video game involves various characters, objects in the surroundings and other such nuances that needs to be dealt with simultaneously. Dealing with each element or object within the game requires a fair amount of threads to monitor every object.For example, take this screen-shot of a role-playing strategy game on the right. Here the game visuals depict various in-game characters moving about on the screen. Now imagine processing the movements, direction and behaviors of each of the characters visible on screen. It would certainly take a lot of time moving each character one-by-one if this were to be done one task after another. However if fundamentals of multi-threading are employed, each character would move in a synchronous manner with respect to others.Threads are not only used heavily in video games, their use is common in everything from simple browser applications to complex operating systems and networking applications. Today it often goes beyond the simple preference of the developer but into the need to maximize the usefulness of contemporaneous hardware that is predicated in heavy multitasking.
