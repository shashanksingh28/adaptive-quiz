Overloading and Overriding - Constructor overloading
The constructor can be overloaded. You can define more than one constructor with different parameters. For example:In the code listing 4.12, we defined two constructors, one with no input parameter, and one with one input parameter. You may ask which constructor will be called. Its depends how the object is created with the new keyword. See below:In the code section 4.29, we created two objects from the same class, or we can also say that obj1 and obj2 both have the same type. The difference between the two is that in the first one the memberField field is not initialized, in the second one that is initialized to "Init Value". A constructor may also be called from another constructor, see below:In the code listing 4.13, the constructor with no input parameter calls the other constructor with the default initial value. This call must be the first instruction of a constructor or else a compiler error will occur. The code gives an option to the user, to create the object with the default value or create the object with a specified value. The first constructor could have been written using the this keyword as well:Such a call reduces the code repetition.
