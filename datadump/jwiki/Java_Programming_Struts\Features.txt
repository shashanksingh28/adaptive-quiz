Java Programming/Struts - Features
Create a screen by assembling Tiles : header, footer, menu, body, etc. Definitions can take place:Definitions provide an inheritance mechanism : a definition can extend another one, and override parameters.Define common page layouts and reuse them across your web site. Define menu layouts, and use them by passing lists of items and links. Define a portal layout, use it by passing a list of Tiles (pages) to show. Reuse existing layouts, or define your own.Tiles can be gathered dynamically during page reload. It is possible to change any attribute: layout, list of Tiles in portal, list of menu items, etc.If well defined, a Tile can be reused across multiple applications. Dynamic attributes are used to parameterize Tiles. It is possible to define a library of reusable Tiles. Build a page by assembling predefined components, giving them appropriate parameters.It is possible to load different tiles according to Locale. A mechanism similar to Java properties files is used for definitions files: you can have one definition file per Locale. The appropriate definition is loaded according to the current Locale.It is possible to load different Tiles according to a key. For example, the key could be user privilege, browser type, arbitrary name stored in session, etc. A mechanism similar to Java properties files is used for definitions files: you can have one definition file per key. The appropriate definition is loaded according to the key.
