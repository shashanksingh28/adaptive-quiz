Understanding a Java Program
This article presents a small Java program which can be run from the console. It computes the distance between two points on a plane.

Also, because the program is intended as a simple introduction, it has some room for improvement, and later in the module we will show some of these improvements. But let's not get too far ahead of ourselves!
