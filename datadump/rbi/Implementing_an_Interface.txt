Implementing an Interface
To declare a class that implements an interface, you include an implements clause in the class declaration. Your class can implement more than one interface, so the implements keyword is followed by a comma-separated list of the interfaces implemented by the class. By convention, the implements clause follows the extends clause, if there is one.Consider an interface that defines how to compare the size of objects.If you want to be able to compare the size of similar objects, no matter what they are, the class that instantiates them should implement Relatable.Any class can implement Relatable if there is some way to compare the relative "size" of objects instantiated from the class. For strings, it could be number of characters; for books, it could be number of pages; for students, it could be weight; and so forth. For planar geometric objects, area would be a good choice (see the RectanglePlus class that follows), while volume would work for three-dimensional geometric objects. All such classes can implement the isLargerThan() method.If you know that a class implements Relatable, then you know that you can compare the size of the objects instantiated from that class.Here is the Rectangle class that was presented in the Creating Objects section, rewritten to implement Relatable.Because RectanglePlus implements Relatable, the size of any two RectanglePlus objects can be compared.
