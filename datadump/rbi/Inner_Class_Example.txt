Inner Class Example
To see an inner class in use, first consider an array. In the following example, you create an array, fill it with integer values, and then output only values of even indices of the array in ascending order.The DataStructure.java example that follows consists of:The output is:Note that the EvenIterator class refers directly to the arrayOfInts instance variable of the DataStructure object.You can use inner classes to implement helper classes such as the one shown in the this example. To handle user interface events, you must know how to use inner classes, because the event-handling mechanism makes extensive use of them.There are two additional types of inner classes. You can declare an inner class within the body of a method. These classes are known as local classes. You can also declare an inner class within the body of a method without naming the class. These classes are known as anonymous classes.You can use the same modifiers for inner classes that you use for other members of the outer class. For example, you can use the access specifiers private, public, and protected to restrict access to inner classes, just as you use them to restrict access do to other class members.
